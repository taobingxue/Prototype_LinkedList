### Tech

- Unity 5.5.1
- Oculus Utilities 1.11.0
- Oculus Avatar sdk 1.10.1 (for Oculus Touch)

### Design

Flying Flags Prototype is a Virtual Reality experience in Oculus Rift that aims to illustrate the concept of Linked Lists. 

In this prototype, the player is expected to concatenate a target word by reordering "flags" in the experience. The "reordering" interaction corresponds to the basic operations on linked list. We expect to teach the basic operations of linked list by letting them do the interactions in this prototype.

Our team believes that if the player can act out the linked list operations using flags, they can learn the essence of linked list.
